# facebook-style-online-chatroom
A simple facebook style online chat room, can one-to-one or multi-person.

# Introduction
This is part of my team's final project of the "software engineering" course in June 2016.   
I contributed to the friend and message system.   

# Features
1. Show friend list.
2. Can chat with your friends(more than 2 persons).
3. The left side(histroy) is sort by the last message's send time, it will constantly change it's order.
4. If the chatroom has the message that you do not read yet, the chatroom's background color will change.

# Database
If you want to write your own website, you need to change 4 lines in *config.php*    
<code>$host="";</code>    
<code>$db_username="";</code>     
<code>$password="";</code>    
<code>$database="";</code>    

Also, you need to create 3 tables:
